# Rails
Rails is a specialized TypeScript library designed to simulate straight rigid bodies with attached objects that
may move along the length of the enclosing rigid body due to gravitaty and rotational inertia (sometimes referred to 
as centrifugal force), such as a tiny monorail sliding on a rail as the rail is spun through the air.
